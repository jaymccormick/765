### Puntambekar, S. & H&ouml;bscher, R. (2005). Tools for scaffolding students in a complex learning environment: What have we gained and what have we missed? *Educational Pyschologist 40*(1), 1-12.

#### Overview
Scaffolding is a theory of teaching and learning. The teaching theory is the teacher's understanding of the problem at hand and how it can be approached and solved. The learning theory is the teacher's understanding of the student's skills and progress. The teacher uses these two theories to calibrate her support to keep the student in the "zone of proximal development". Moreover, the support is more inclusive than a purely academic model would capture. It includes perceptual, cognitive and affective domains.

Key Features:
- ZPD. The teacher keeps the student in the zone of proximal development, "the distance between the child's actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the higher level of potential development as determined through problem solving under [teacher] guidance and in collaboration with more capable peers"
- Multidimensional & Shared Goal. The teacher is an expert and a facilitator knowledgeable about the skills, strategies and processes required for effective learning. The teacher provides:
  - Motivation by providing just enough support to enable the student to accomplish the goal;
  - Modeling to highlight the critical features of the task;
  - Hints and questions that encourage learner reflection.
- Dynamic. Calibrated support through ongoing interactions. This is accomplished through the "dialogic and interactive nature of scaffolded instruction".
- Fading. When the learner has internalized the responsibility of solving the problem

#### Hits
- In general, challenging the notion that human-to-human interaction can be replicated with human-computer interaction, and discussing the limitations of an HCI implementation of scaffolding
- The discussion of the limits (really, the lack) of fading in HCI scaffolds: "fading is not automatic but has to be explicitly initiated by the student"
- The idea that fading in the context of scaffolding software could mean removing the software tool altogether.
- Peer support is not the same as tutor support. Peer interactions may encourage exploration and performance and motivate learners. Expert-novice interactions entail an assessment of the learner's skills and tailored support (interactions absent in peer interactions)

#### Misses
- I would like to have seen more of a design proposal for a solution to the problem of (1) the difficulty of scaling scaffolding beyond 1 teacher and one learner and (2) the limitations of scaffolding as implemented in an HCI model
- "[E]ffective scaffolding needs to be distributed, integrated and multiplied": yes, true (although it's unclear what "distributed", "integrated" and "multiplied" means here). But *how* can we do that? Or, what sources have attempted or described the path to doing that?

#### Overview
The exponential user growth in social networks' membership that makes Marc Andreesen swoon is based on a zero cost model. Joining and using Facebook are free. Interestingly, Twitter is bringing the NFL to users; the social network that has the most existential angst is the one that has to do the most work generating content to keep its users engaged. Facebook must offer its users more, because it focuses on its websites architecture and interactions rather than its content. Facebook is a teeming city; Twitter is an empty mall.

So with that as a background, let's imagine the next frontier for social networking. What about a social network for farmers? But not just any farmers... they're farmers with no infrastructure around them; they live in huts and don't have running water. Also, they speak an obscure dialect, and they can't read.

What struck me is the lack of human-centered design principles. The research question is "How can we design a social network for illiterate farmers?" That's an interesting academic question (that feels decidedly less academic since 3 of the 4 coauthors are Microsoft employees). (As an aside to the thin academic gloss on this project: what exactly do the researchers mean when they say they obtained "informed verbal consent" from the farmers? I would be surprised if the farmers, who have no experience with digital technology or general information sources like newspapers, let alone academic articles, actually understood what they were consenting to.) But it wholly ignores a much broader question: What do illiterate farmers need help doing? The authors make a tenuous connection to a local organization that is using videos and other digital tutorials to disseminate farming and animal tending best practices. Peter F. Drucker, in Entrepreneurship and Innovation (1985), shares a story of European motorbike manufacturers who introduced motorbikes to India, thinking that India's weak infrastructure and poor population were a perfect environment for the cheap convenient travel afforded by a motorbike. Sales were poor, except in an agricultural area in India. Farmers in the agricultural area were buying the motorbikes for their motors, which they stripped from the motorbikes and used to run irrigation pumps. The engineer who discovered this founded an irrigation pump company and was incredibly successful. Here, we are introducing a social network to India; I wonder what they would do with it if they could

Then the researchers advise that without "mediators", people who can read, have phones, and have a basic understanding of technology and social networks, this social network would not have worked. Tellingly, the section devoted to the importance of mediator participation is entitled "Incentivization of Mediators Crucial". Even with the mediators, it's not clear that the social network can actually be called a "success" - mediators were responsible for signing up farmers to the social network, but neither the mediators nor farmers could articulate what exactly they received by joining this network. One mediator, who had signed up 35 farmers, "could not tell the farmers what the system was for as he did not know himself."

#### Hits
- There is no current good solution for passwords for illiterate and low-literacy users. Whatever one might think of this project, the insight is an important one. Imagine low-literacy users trying to access basic information about themselves, like accessing government aid, or finding out health information.
- "[T]echnological interventions will be more effective if they take into consideration the underlying infrastructures such as intermediation that are embedded in the community." I think this means, Think of communities you are designing for, rather than individuals, because individuals receive support from their communities.

#### Misses
- The idea of informed consent from illiterate farmers about participating in a social network using mobile phones.
- Asking the farmers what they wanted (pictures of gods and actors; religious songs) as a way to "iterate" the next version of the network. Since when did asking users for specific product recommendations yield product features that are innovative, or even actually helpful?

### Bae, J., Lim, Y, Bang, J. & Kim, M. (2014). Ripening Room: Designing Social Media for Self-Expression. *DIS 2014*, 103-112.

#### Overview
Industrial design students in South Korea assert that the fundamental design flaw of social media is that it does not "support users' self-reflection". To remedy this design flaw, they propose a social network website that requires users to select a "ripening time", between 1 minute and 48 hours, during which the post is visible only to them. While the ripening window is open, they can edit the post as much as they like. Once it is posted, they cannot change it.

The students built in a scoring process - a combination of ripening time and votes from other users on a post's "maturity". They intended the scoring process "to motivate users to earn higher points, and an increase in score would give positive feedback, resulting in a a sense of achievement in the social media context."

#### Hits
- The premise is interesting. Why do we carelessly share personal information? Why do we heedlessly interact with others online? Perhaps some sort of delay is helpful.
- Interesting user insights: not interacting with her phone was "40 minutes of endless pain." And "I've tried to get away from smart phones and computers, and focused on reading books. But in 10 minutes, my hand got impatient to touch my phone!"
- The recognition that social media "provide[s] purposeless connectedness and the hedonic pleasures of gossip, not... the pursuit of.. self-reflection. Will users' desire to use social media" fall when the platform encourages self-reflection?

#### Misses
- The assumption that social media can, and should, encourage personal growth: "It is important that social media encourage users to express their inner thoughts and emotions if they are to collect meaningful resources for self-reflection, because it is not always guaranteed that users' activities will create meaningful resources."

### Gentner, D. & Nielson, J. (1996). The Anti-Mac Interface. *Communications of the ACM 39*(8) 71-82.

#### Overview
Is the Windows-Icons-Menu-Pointer model the final innovation in GUIs? Gertner and Nielson hope not - but in the 20 years since this article, I don't see that much has changed.

#### Hits
- The Mac interface is "good enough to be criticized". I think that's a useful way to think about criticism, that we're only criticizing what is good and can become better. We aren't spending time on interfaces that aren't even good to begin with.
- Metaphors are not as helpful as they seem. Cars were originally controlled by reins, like horses, but that metaphor constrained the design without helping drivers. Maybe metaphors are there most helpful when we are working with novel concepts. Learning and adaptation build new mental structures that are better constructs than the original metaphor. Gentner and Nielson strain their analysis here, describing metaphors in terms of mappings between the target and source domain.
- "The dark side of direct manipulation is that you have to manipulate everything."
- If applications arrange themselves to fit our needs, they are dynamic yet feel dependable.
- They make a general point about how much rote work GUIs saddle us with.

#### Misses
- Although their observation that we lack the power of language, and instead must communicate primitively by pointing and clicking, rings true, their design solution - that we should spend as many years mastering interactions with computers as we do with other humans (20, in their estimation) - is absurd and contradicted by their other points that computers should be more responsive to our needs. I also doubt that computers could be programmed with language capability that would evolve with our own. (Until A.I. enables that, at which point there will be other issues to deal with than using natural language to manipulate files on our PCs).
