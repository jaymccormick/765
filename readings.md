#### Overview
argues for addressing "quality of life" as an explicit design goal, rather than focusing on safety or well-being of people with dementia and improving quality of life as a side effect

#### Hits
- developing a product design and development plan that focuses on researching quality of life for people with dementia and determining how to design a product that supports and improves it
- reviewing 3 products developed with this plan, and especially discussing the unexpected shortcomings of designs, e.g. how the visible, circular speakers on the CD player were confusing to users with dementia
- describing 'Wizard of Oz' technique for testing a product

#### Misses
- references 'grounded theory', and interesting sociological theory, but does not discuss why it was chosen or what it provided

### Frauenberger, C. (2015, October). Disability and technology: A critical realist perspective. In *Proceedings of the 17th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers & Accessibility* (pp. 89-96). ACM.

#### Overview
argues that designers' conceptual and philosophical model of what disability is - purely physical, purely social - influences how they imagine and develop solutions in the form of assistive technology. that is certainly true; i wonder if, as the author argues, there is a unifying aspect of disability (presented by critical realism); or if, alternatively, there is no unifying disability philosophy, but rather a disability that depends on the circumstances of the person. disability studies distinguishes impairment - the physical or psychological trait - from disability - the imposed trait, like inaccessible buildings or "precarious positions in the labor market"

#### Hits
- thinking about a new dimension for assistive technology "AT" to address/solve problems in
- describing a history of disability philosophies

#### Misses
- i'm not sure how 'outside the box' design is really that different from other participatory design methods

#### Overview
describes and explores "shape-changing interfaces", which transform their shape for input and output;

#### Hits
- interesting brief discussion of Swedish engineer Christopher Polhelm's mechanical alphabet
- would the "surflex" be subsumed by 3D printing?
- i would like a "shape changing laptop" that enables me to lift the screen well above the keyboard, so i don't have to sit so hunched over

#### Misses
- great catalog of some neat interfaces, but thin on discussion of why they solve a problem better than other solutions

#### Overview
'uncomfortable interactions' cause physical or mental discomfort - and should be mild and consensually experienced (to the extent that people know, generally, something unpleasant is going to happen)
flips the idea of designing for ease, comfort, and pleasure on its head; i really like an alternative take on designing for ease. imaging how boring life would be if there were no challenges!

#### Hits
- the idea of designing for the full range of emotions is clever
- makes me wonder what circumstances would be good for uncomfortable interactions. perhaps behavior change, e.g. around smoking? bullying?
- getting people to empathize difficult emotions is valuable

#### Misses
- a bit too far towards the 'artification' of design in the discussion of the swing and some of the performance art pieces

#### Overview
- i'm not sure that lack of access to potable water in, say, India, has anything to do with illiberal water consumption rates in, say, California. not that the goal of improving water conservation is frivolous by any means. just that it's not important for that reason.
- installed water use sensors in public bathroom and in private shower; sensors provided feedback, which encouraged conversation and appeared to change behaviors

#### Hites
- really great conceptual overview of how they built the water sensor using an Arduino MVR microcontroller and continuously sampling the sound signal against the unique waveform of the water turning on
- contrary to one participant's claim that his water use is already "reasonable", the sensor measured his water use as the highest water use of anyone in the study
- the ambient display seemed to work better - it was simpler and more direct to show green or red than to show a number for how much water was consumed

#### Misses
- personal curiosity about water use "can lead to large-scale personal and societal change". really?
- i doubt that long showers and excessive hand washing are a cause of "land subsistence", "reduced water flow in lakes and streams", and receding water levels.
- water is not a "declining resource"; maybe potable water, or easy to clean water, is declining. but not water.
- "sewer overflow" is a "byproduct of excessive water use" and "leads to pollution". i'm not sure how a sewer could overflow because of excessive water use.

#### Overview
since bathing is around 1/3 of household water use, this calendar is intended to reduce water consumption for bathing. the calendar shows indvidual's water consumption, represented as a dot whose size was inversely proportional to water consumption.

#### Hits
- a "cornerstone" of behavior change is appropriate feedback. that's general, but certainly true and a good point to remember and focus on
- using dot size inverse to water consumption; people were competing on dot sizes!

#### Misses
- not sure what distinguishes an ambient display from a non-ambient one.
- "all in all" - what does that phrase mean?
- uses the word "ambient" to describe displays it asserts are ambient. for example, their ambient shower calendar uses a dot as a "fuzzy, ambient representation"

In *Proceedings of the 2014 Workshop on Roadmapping the Future of Multimodal Interaction Research including Business Opportunities and Challenges* (pp. 39-42). ACM.

#### Overview
- ROCKIT will "integrate the vision and innovation agendas of a broad range of stakeholders"
- provides an interesting overview of opportunities for innovation. but more of an RFP than a roadmap, i.e. asks for innovation, perhaps proposes what innovation might do, but doesn't go beyond that.

#### Hits
- roadmapping identifies gaps and finds connections among diverse interests. in other words, "planning". still, good to think about aligning & connecting
- enterprise knowledge management is on the map! nice to see the software my company specializes in appear there as an opportunity and goal. and perhaps there's a reason that enterprise software offers such an opportunity -  see Rettig, C. (2007). The trouble with enterprise software. *MIT Sloan management review, 49*(1), 21:
> Back-office systems — including both software applications and the data they process — are a variegated patchwork of systems, containing 50 or more databases and hundreds of separate software programs installed over decades and interconnected by idiosyncratic, Byzantine and poorly documented customized processes.

#### Misses
- pretty repetitive in stating the goal of bringing stakeholders together.
- uses a SWOT analysis - a strategic business case framework - to analyze an industry

#### Overview
Study examined whether humans were influenced by human-like robots by analyzing whether they changed their answer for valuation to conform to the robot's valuation

#### Hits
- humans are more social with robots that are more human-like
- the human-like iCub robot + social gaze (rather than fixed gaze) had a stronger effect on participants
- humans can be 'primed' with a human-like robot, so that their subsequent activities with non-human-like robots showed no difference

#### Misses
- since this is a military article, it would have been interesting to hear about military experiences with robots, e.g. how people in the military begin to get attached to robots they work with despite the robots' being completely unhuman in appearance

#### Overview
- anthropomorphism is "ascrib[ing]" human characteristics to non-human entities, including "emotional states, motivations, [and] intentions"
- this paper proposes a model of "anthropomorphic effects": instances of observable anthropomorphism: initialization, familiarization, stabilization

#### Hits
- the model:
  1. initialization: seconds to hours, in which anthropomorphism increases from an initial state to a local maximum
  2. familiarization: the human constructs a model of the robot's motivations and inclinations, to predict its behavior
  3. stabilization: the stable level of anthropomorphism

#### Misses
- the model is really interesting; i would have liked either (1) a review or reference to other models, or (2) some more thought about measuring or implementing or using the model

#### Misses

#### Overview
There are limits to attending to available visual information:
- **Change blindness**: the failure to detect a clear and obvious change
- **inattentional blindness**: change blindness without a visual disruption

#### Hits
- gradual changes on mobile screens are more likely to be missed; cluttering hampers change detection
- **One-window drill-down**: design pattern to focus attention; key is to minimize interaction costs while maximizing probability of detecting changes

#### Misses
- would have been interesting to explore more outside of mobile interfaces

#### Misses

### Jacob, M. G., Li, Y. T., Akingba, G. A., & Wachs, J. P. (2013). Collaboration with a robotic scrub nurse. *Communications of the ACM, 56*(5), 68-75.

#### Overview
Communication errors - failures, ignored requests, delays - major source of errors in operating rooms. Reduce cognitive load, and reduce instrument mistakes, by using a robotic nurse to provide tools and request tools from the doctor

#### Hits
- hand gestures to communicate with the robotic scrub nurse to request instruments. interesting work-around for a noisy environment and enables a purely visual robot
- 97% recognition accuracy for commands seems much higher than the current operating room, based on the communication failure rates of around 30% the article quotes.
- how well does a robot do compared to a close-knit team?
- after training, the gestures are faster than verbal communication

#### Misses
- did the team try to do too much? rather than use a robot to give tools, isn't a better proximate goal to have the robot track what tools are in use (and ensure none are left in the patient)

### D'Mello, S., & Calvo, R. A. (2013, April). Beyond the basic emotions: what should affective computing compute?. In *CHI'13 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems* (pp. 2287-2294). ACM.

#### Overview
Basic emotions: anger, surprise, happiness, disgust (e.g., presence in primates, coherence in response systems, among other characteristics).
Non-basic (secondary?): boredom, confusion, frustration.
Non-basic emotions occur 5:1 to to basic emotions in this metastudy (limited to research projects completed in this specific lab)

#### Hits
- arguing for non-basic emotions over basic emotions in affective computing. that accords with my personal intuition that, for example, designing for delight is a bad design goal because delight as an emotion fades, whereas designing for focus and engagement can sustain those feelings
- both questioning the data and analyzing why it is dependable: the analysis is based on only 5 studies, but it has 15,000 discrete emotional reports
- "the tasks... can be decomposed into primitive[s]... such as reading text, providing responses, receiving feedback on actions"

#### Misses
- could have been more critical of designing for basic emotions

### Vacca, R., Bromley, M., Leyrer, J., Sprung, M., & Homer, B. (2014, January). Designing games for emotional health. In *Learning, Education and Games* (pp. 123-140). ETC Press.

#### Overview
"[G]ood emotional health... suggests that an individual has the ability to manage [her] emotional responses in ways that contribute positively to [her] overall sense of well-being, rather than an absence of 'negative' emotions."

#### Hits
- social interaction and emotional health link
- the Emotional Regulation Process Model (Gross & Barrett, 2011) that shows five opportunities to train emotions
- Executive function helps moderate responses, resolve conflicting thoughts by (1) directing attention, (2) self-monitoring, (3) planning, (4) organizing, (5) remembering, (6) inhibiting impulsivity
- emotional health as (1) adopting different perspectives, (2) relaxing the body, (3) nonjudgmentally experiencing the emotion, (4) redirecting attention

#### Misses
- would "collecting coins to correspond to the appropriate emotion" make a difference in emotional intelligence or regulation?

### Deci, E.L., Eghrari, H., Patrick, B.C., and Leone, D.R. (1994). Facilitating internalization: The self-determination theory perspective. *Journal of Personality 62*(1): 119-142.

#### Overview
- **introjection**: self-regulation through "pressured demanding of oneself", including "pressure, tension and anxiety", implicating one's self-worth and making "self-esteem... contingent upon an outcome".
- **integration**: self-regulation by identifying "with the value of an activity" and accepting responsibility for doing it. doing the activity is "wholly volitionally because of its utility or importance for one's personal goals". there is no tension or conflict; consistency or coherence between the person's behavior and internal states is greater
- 192 college students in 2x2x2 experiment. providing a rationale, acknowledging feelings, and conveying choice are relevant. not clear how the variables interact (as supportiveness of the context decreases, does introjection become more likely?). seems to be a threshold effect, i.e. it behaves like a step function, so once an environment is sufficiently supportive, integration occurs

#### Hits
- integrated internalization support:
  - provide a meaningful rationale: a reason relevant to the person for why self-regulation of the activity would have personal utility, e.g. picking up your room helps you keep track of your toys
  - acknowledge the behaver's perspective: acknowledge the conflict between the request and the discinclination to do it; alleviates tensio and helps person understand that the behavior can exist harmoniously with her inclinations. "i know that it's not fun for you to spend time picking up your room". acknowledging conflicting feelings helps facilitate self-determination
  - convey autonomy: this is tricky. "shoulds", "musts", and "have tos" are "pressuring locution" that is likely to decrease intrinsic motivation. allow the person to feel free to choose
  - research:
    - personally identifying with the outcome of a task resulted in subjects' feeling antagonistic to self-determination and reduces intrinsic motivation
    - school children who did schoolwork "because they should" and to avoid guilt experienced more school-related anxiety and coped poorly with failure; school children who did school work because it was "important for them to know" were internally motivated
    - self-determined (integrated) style: school enjoyment, conceptual understanding, and proactive coping
    - self-determination and integration are "natural, intrinsically motivated tendencies"
    - with self-determination support, internalization is greater and integrated; without self-determination support, it is less and introjected
    - parental autonomy support: positively affected childrens' self-determined forms of regulation school performance

#### Misses
- facilitating integration seems like a pretty crucial part of the paper, and it does receive some attention. but more explication of what 'autonomy-supporting' language is (or more in general how to get it right as a parent) would have been nice

### Deterding, S., Dixon, D., Khaled, R., and Nacke, L. (2001) From dame design elements to gamefulness: Defining "gamification". In *Proceeedings of the 15th International Academic MindTrek Conference: Envisioning Future Media Environments*, MindTrek '11, pages 9-15, New York, NY, USA.

#### Overview
I really like articles like this, which survey the thinking on a concept and propose a different way of understanding what the concept is.
- Apparently "began" with Foursquare
- Premise of gamification: (1) ubiquity of videogames in everyday life; (2) video games elicit intense engagement, and so using elements of games should likewise elicit strong engagement
- Games for "serious purposes" date back thousands of years to military training; they became common in business and education since the 1950s; digitization has increased the pace and extent
- **pervasive games**: expand play spatially, temporally or socially
  - AR overlay
  - location-based
  - alternate-reality games that add meaning, depth, and interaction to the real world
- **gamification**: "the use of game design elements in non-game contexts"
  - distinct from playfulness, playful interaction, and playful design

#### Hits
- "gameful design" uses "gamefulness" (the experiential and behavioral quality) and "gameful interaction" (artifacts that afford gamefulness)
- at what point does an artificat have enough "gameful" elements that it is a game?
  - what are "gameful elements" anyway?
    - interface design patterns
    - game design patterns or game mechanics
    - design principles, heuristics or lenses
    - conceptual models of game design units
    - game design methods and design processes
- "designers work with mechanics to create aesthetics, whereas players experience aesthetics, and in so doing, infer knowledge about mechanics"
- is a "meta-game" like an achievement system a "gameful element"? no, it is a full-fledged game

#### Misses
- the "Ludification of Culture" visual that "situated" gameful design in society seemed contrived. remarking that "media scholars observe a 'ludification of culture'" the authors offer no other information on that phenomenon. how has it happened? to what extent? is it good? perhaps those are questions for other papers. but some more context and analysis, even an extra sentence, would have gone a long way

### Scheiter, K. & Gerjets, P. (2007). Learner control in hypermedia environments. *Educational Psychology Review 19*(3), 285-307.

#### Overview
Nicely discusses the promise and shortcoming of hypermedia environments. I suppose that as a hypothetical matter, if one could design a system so that learning occurred for every user, that system would have to be better than the most skilled teacher. Otherwise skilled teachers would have developed systems (analog systems, before the advent of digital ones) that accomplished this. That reasoning feels tautological, but still I think the issue is that there's nothing so different about a digital interface - in its current form - that obviates the challenges of learning (and teaching). One counterexample is the availability of alternative explanations and additional examples on digital interfaces is much higher than in analog ones.

Another issue the authors observe is "most of the current research lacks a clear conceptual foundation that allows deriving testable hypotheses on how effective hypermedia should be designed." Hypermedia design without an "instruction approach... and the cognitive structures, processes and resources necessary to benefit from this approach" produces findings with little general application.

#### Hits
- schema theory as an explanation for the benefit that learners with prior knowledge obtain from hypermedia, whereas learners without prior knowledge struggle: "individuals with extensive prior knowledge are better able to invoke schema-driven selections, wherein knowledge needs are accurately identified a priori and selections made accordingly.... Those with limited prior knowledge... are unable to establish information needs in advance"
- less studied but "promising": affect of "complex epistemological beliefs" on hypermedia learning success. more complex epistemological beliefs (one can improve one's knowledge, knowledge is intricate and interrelated, learning is effortful) extract more information and retain it more completely than learners with simple epistemological beliefs
- the importance of metacognition: learners using hypermedia must "be able to monitor their own comprehension of the information presented..., select appropriate strategies for correcting any misconceptions, and develop information-seeking strategies that facilitate integrating... and synthesizing information".

#### Misses
- the section on epistemological beliefs was interesting, but it lacked a definition of complex epistemological beliefs, so i was left to think of complex epistemological beliefs as "not simple epistemological", e.g. one dimension of simple epistemological beliefs is "knowledge exists as discrete facts (simple knowledge)". i suppose the opposite of that is that knowledge exists as interrelated facts (?)

### Mekler, E.D. & Hornbaek, K. (2016). Momentary pleasure or lasting meaning? Distinguishing eudaimonic and hedonic user experiences. In *Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*, CHI '16, 4509-4520, New York, NY, USA.

#### Overview
"Happiness is an ambiguous term." (p. 4510). That is certainly true.

- eudaemonic and hedonic motives are not necessarily mutually exclusive
- eudaemonic: accomplishment of personal goals, positive affect, meaning, and long-term importance.
- eudaemonia: "efforts to align one's actions with one's values".

The need to find or create meaning is powerful - see, e.g., Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl:
>A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the 'why' for his existence, and he will be able to bear almost any 'how'.

Frankl, V. (2006). *Man's search for meaning*. Boston, MA: Beacon Press.

But see Holocaust survivor Primo Levi on being seen by a former teacher, who became a chemist for the Nazis, at Auschwtiz:
> That look did not pass between two men; and if I knew how to explain fully the nature of that look, exchanged as it through the glass wall of an aquarium between two being who inhabit different worlds, I would also be able to explain the essence of the great insanity of the Third Reich.

Levi, P. (1959). *If this is a man*. The Orion Press: New York, NY.

Perhaps then designing for meaning is to design in a way that allows the creation of meaning. Or, perhaps it supports meaning by conveying that the experience is meaningful. Imagine handing a craftsmen a beautiful tool, to support her work and to acknowledge that her work is worthy of a tool that is artistic in its form.

#### Hits
- positive psychology distinguishes hedonia and eudaemonia by *motivation*
- description of measuring positive UX (based on needs for autonomy, competence, relatedness, self-actualization, stimulation, security and popularity)
- empirically identifying eudaemonic user experiences:
  - learning
  - working toward a personal goal
  - helping friends or family
  - stability of future importance
  - competence and self-assurance
- empirically identifying hedonic user experiences:
  - momentary pleasure
  - little or no connection to a future goal
- learning, helping and future importance
- AttrakDiff as a good starting point, but noting that it was not developed to measure eudaemonia or hedonia, but rather hedonia and utilitarianism
- people experience, e.g., learning a programming language differently (is it "fun", part of a self-actualizing, goal-seeking experience, or mandated by work?)

#### Misses
- not really a miss, but more of a question: is it possible to take these findings and design something to be "eudaemonic"? Even the authors raise this question, quoting Zimmerman: "the intended outcome of this approach - making someone feel they are becoming the person they desire to be in a specific role - is a very difficult thing to measure because it is nearly impossible to control for"

### Ochsner, A. (2015). Lessons learned with girls, games and design. In *Proceedings of the Third Conference on GenderIT* GenderIT '15*, 24-31, New York, NY, USA.

#### Overview
Interesting early reference to research that gaming can improve "computational thinking". Since the reference seemed to indicate a general benefit to gaming of any kind, I read the cited article and found a narrower scope:
> At their most base level, games are systems of rules in which players operate on  representations. In a computer game, those rules are generally executed and strictly enforced by the game itself. Board games and other table top games, on the other hand, have no such inherent game rule management; it becomes incumbent upon the players themselves to know and execute the rules of the game. The players are doing the computation that would normally be the purview of the computer or console in a video game.[1]

So it is the specific set of table-top games with complex rules and no rule management structure that encourages the development of computational thinking, not games in general.

<hr>
[1] Berland, M., & Lee, V. R. (2001). Collaborative strategic board games as a site for distributed computational thinking. *International Journal of Game-Based Learning 1*(2), 65-81.

#### Hits
- "pink games" (traditionally, perhaps stereotypically) oriented to girls' interests and "purple games" (broader view of what appeals to girls); market research as a pragmatic basis versus designing for what would interest girls if they had the support and encouragement to play games; lack of marketing and retail support & the "happy accident" when games do appeal to girls
- mastery tends not to interest girls; girls like relationship- and experience-oriented games; narrative is important to girls
- TechSavvy girls modified and played Sims 2, developing IT fluencies and experimenting with socially acceptable and powerful identities, and engaging in "collaborative problem solving" through a distinctive approach that blended "technical skills with emotional intelligence". but in the Rapunsel game (middle school girls used Java to program characters to dance), researchers "felt that focusing on social engagement tended to draw attention away from the programming activities." Rapunsel did increase self-efficacy and confidence among the girls

#### Misses
- overall this was a good article; the one miss i discussed above, which is the imprecise discussion of the benefit of games (strategy-based table top games with complex rules encourage the development of computational thinking; games in general do not)

### Kultima, A. & Stenros, J. (2010). Designing games for everyone: The expanded game experience model. In *Proceedings of the International Academic Conference on the Future of Game Design and Technology*, Futureplay '10, pages 66-73, New York, NY, US.

#### Overview
Interesting to think the context of game play. My experience has been that social games are like Mario Kart, and intensive games are like Halo 2 and 3, and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. The former is not fun without other players; the latter are fun independent of social play. We would pass the controller back and forth in the intensive games, playing through a "life" or a level.
The EGE is intended as a design heuristic, a simplification of the gaming experience to support the game design process.
Casual games, since they are not immersive, bring the external environment into the game-design realm. So casual games designed solely to have easy gameplay and general appeal might miss the context of play that will determine the success (adoption) of the game. Thus designers of casual games must understand the lifecycle of game play as beginning and ending outside of the game, and as bringing the outside world into the game world throughout game play.

Adds additional levels to a gaming taxonomy:
- Experience
  - Situation
    - Worldview
      - User State
        - Resources
        - Motives
- Behavior
  - Activities
- Game Design
  - Affordances
    - Receivables
    - Possibilities
  - Thresholds
    - Restrictions
    - Requirements

#### Hits
- "very few users actually fit the user profiles drawn from the player data they generate." That is, designing for the "casual gamer" creates an exclusive category where there is not one; gamers play casual and intensive games, and are not exclusively one or the other.
- "The notions of challenge, immersion, flow and meaningful actions are well established, but they may not be enough" to continue the design progress of the past thirty years.
- game researchers "often examine games through their own play experiences and through the eyes of enthusiastic gamers and game fans". This is a bias that could *maintain* the state of game design, but will struggle to improve it.

#### Misses
- the idea that design is "second-order", which appeared in Kultima's other article, is interesting. but it's also imprecise. there's nothing tenuous about a second-order condition's relation to the underlying model. the derivative of a function is as certain as the function itself. i think "stochastic" is a better term. I don't know what makes game design any more stochastic than design in other systems; it is an interesting effect to observe, though.
- language in general: what does it mean for a game experience to be "versatile", "fluent", or "powerful"?

### Kultima, A. (2009). Casual game design values. In *Proceedings of the 13th International MindTrek Conference: Everyday Life in the Ubiquitous Era*, MindTrek '09, pages 58-65, New York, NY, USA.

#### Overview
Casual games are higher in: Acceptability (social norm conformity), Accessibility (cognitive, physical, economic), Simplicity (in game rules and environment; also, automating processes like saving) and Flexibility (change devices, locations, attention level)
20% AGR in casual games; 51% of 200MM online players are women;
casual game design and "hardcore" or "traditional" games "form a valence"
- in **graph theory**: the number of edges incident to a vertex (with loops counted 2x)
- in psychology: the attractiveness (positive valence) or aversiveness (negative valence) of an event. (ambivalence thus can be seen as a conflict between positive and negative valence carriers)
- in **linguistics**: the number of arguments controlled by a verbal predicate
  - It rains. 0 valence
  - He sleeps. 1 valence.
  - He gave her a flower. 3 valence.
- in **chemistry**: the measure of an element's combining power with other elements when it forms chemical compounds or molecules

#### Hits
- game design is "second-order design": game rules are designed directly, and the game experience is a result of game rules. game rules do not have entirely predictable effects, so the design of a game is not an exercise in logical but rather in normative assessments and decisions.
- "any simple, small, or easy game can be categorized as 'casual'". true, and good to recognize early in the paper to support the inquiry: what, more specifically, characterizes a category of games that feels eminently recognizable.

#### Misses
- mis-titled subsection (3.3.4 should be Flexibility, not Accessibility (which is discussed in a prior section))
- "The rise of casual game industries indicates a transformation in games cultures..." what is that culture, and what is the change?

### Crabtree, A. & Tolmie, P. (2016). A day in the life of things in the home. In *Proceedingsof the 19th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing*, CSCW '16, pages 1738-1750, New York, NY, USA. ACM.

#### Overview
The authors' endeavor is "[O]pening up the methodical assemblage of things"
Based on "observations in 2 ostensibly middle-class UK homes" - ostensibly: evidently, professed (rather than demonstrably true). are they not middle-class?
Method: Counted the interactions with things - anything and everything, from tea kettles to iPads to couches - over several 3-hour periods
Summary: One can see how events flow in a space by observing the "methodical assemblage of things"; seeing a use pattern across IoT devices will be difficult for machines because there is no intrinsic logical connection among devices' use

#### Hits
- the Internet of Things is "marked largely by the design of *individual things*", resulting in a "*fragemented ecology*" that ignores in its design framework the methodical assemblage of things.
- designing for the home means (or should mean) designing for methodical assemblages of things from multiple categories
- detecting the unique, local methodical assemblage of things is a challenge for algorithms, e.g. machine learning
- seemed to pull off a research paper that used the authors as the research subjects

#### Misses
- too much *italics* (one randomly picked page had 9 instances of *italics*)
- perplexing language use ("The study reported here is rooted in a long tradition of empirical studies.... [which] are 'incommensurate and asymmetrically alternate' to theoretical treatment of whatever colour, shade or hue.")

#### Overview
Taxonomy:
- Data & View Specification
  - Visualize
    - expressiveness of formal grammars; but also "steep learning curve"
  - Filter
    - "dynamic query widgets", e.g. radio buttons, sliders, categories
    - "incremental exploration": is that just 'guess-and-check'?
  - Sort
    - "The goal is to reveal underlying structure (e.g. clustering) within the data."
    - **seriation**: arranging in order by size
  - Derive
    - include tools for deriving new data based on input data to continue the exploration and analysis process
- View Manipulation: patterns within patterns and across data
  - Select
    - limited; don't have the gaze, gestures available (but maybe AR?)
  - Navigate
    - Overview, Zoom and Filter, Details;
    - Search, Show Context, Expand on Demand
    - "How analysts navigate a visualization is in part determined by where they start"
    - 'Linked navigation' that manipulates multiple views simultaneously
  - Coordinate
    - easier to integrate data across views than to add data to a single view
  - Organize
    - managing views, legends, and interactive controls
- Process & Provenance: "iterative data exploration and interpretation"
  - Record
    - interaction histories
    - pattern of exploration
  - Annotate
    - if not "data-aware", become meaningless
  - Share
  - Guide
    - onboarding
    - linking expert creators to novice audience
    - **tacit tutorial** e.g. NY Times

#### Hits
- Generally good hierarchy of actions and related affordances for designing and developing a visualization interface
- nice overview of different visualization technologies. a challenge in describing something dynamic in a static medium (describing dynamic visualization using text) is maintaining clarity without excessive detail. generally the article succeeds at this.
- lays out the interaction steps to think about in designing a visualization platform.
- navigation as Overview->Filter and Zoom->Details-on-demand
- thinking about coordinating multiple views as easier to comprehend than adding variables to a single view

#### Misses
- dry. i don't think anyone else read the article (based on class participation before we discussed this article, during the discussion, and the discussion after it. participation went from high to zero back to high.)
- too much undefined terminology. maybe for the audience it is written for, that is good. and adding definitions and explanations for each term (like data-flow graph, or "operator") would have added at least a few pages to the article.
- no discussion of heuristics; i think visualizations take advantage of humans' powerful visual pattern recognition, and should build in indicators of statistical significance to guide users away from mistaken interpretations of data

### Puntambekar, S. & H&uuml;bscher, R. (2005). Tools for scaffolding students in a complex learning environment: What have we gained and what have we missed? *Educational Pyschologist 40*(1), 1-12.

#### Overview
Scaffolding is a theory of teaching and learning. The teaching theory is the teacher's understanding of the problem at hand and how it can be approached and solved. The learning theory is the teacher's understanding of the student's skills and progress. The teacher uses these two theories to calibrate her support to keep the student in the "zone of proximal development". Moreover, the support is more inclusive than a purely academic model would capture. It includes perceptual, cognitive and affective domains.

Key Features:
- ZPD. The teacher keeps the student in the zone of proximal development, "the distance between the child's actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the higher level of potential development as determined through problem solving under [teacher] guidance and in collaboration with more capable peers"
- Multidimensional & Shared Goal. The teacher is an expert and a facilitator knowledgeable about the skills, strategies and processes required for effective learning. The teacher provides:
  - Motivation by providing just enough support to enable the student to accomplish the goal;
  - Modeling to highlight the critical features of the task;
  - Hints and questions that encourage learner reflection.
- Dynamic. Calibrated support through ongoing interactions. This is accomplished through the "dialogic and interactive nature of scaffolded instruction".
- Fading. When the learner has internalized the responsibility of solving the problem

#### Hits
- In general, challenging the notion that human-to-human interaction can be replicated with human-computer interaction, and discussing the limitations of an HCI implementation of scaffolding
- The discussion of the limits (really, the lack) of fading in HCI scaffolds: "fading is not automatic but has to be explicitly initiated by the student"
- The idea that fading in the context of scaffolding software could mean removing the software tool altogether.
- Peer support is not the same as tutor support. Peer interactions may encourage exploration and performance and motivate learners. Expert-novice interactions entail an assessment of the learner's skills and tailored support (interactions absent in peer interactions)

#### Misses
- I would like to have seen more of a design proposal for a solution to the problem of (1) the difficulty of scaling scaffolding beyond 1 teacher and one learner and (2) the limitations of scaffolding as implemented in an HCI model
- "[E]ffective scaffolding needs to be distributed, integrated and multiplied": yes, true (although it's unclear what "distributed", "integrated" and "multiplied" means here). But *how* can we do that? Or, what sources have attempted or described the path to doing that?

### Medhi-Thies, I., Ferreira, P., Gupta, N, O'Neill, J. & Cutrell, E. (2015). KrishiPustak: A social networking system for low-literate farmers. *CSCW 2015*, 1670-1680.

#### Overview
Exponential user growth in social networks' membership is based on a zero cost model. Joining and using Facebook are free. Interestingly, Twitter is bringing the NFL to users; the social network that has the most existential angst is the one that has to do the most work generating content to keep its users engaged. Facebook must be offering its users more, because it focuses on its websites architecture and interactions rather than its content. Facebook is a teeming city; Twitter is an empty mall.

So with that as a background, let's imagine the next frontier for social networking. What about a social network for farmers? But not just any farmers... they're farmers with no infrastructure around them; they live in huts and don't have running water. Also, they speak an obscure dialect, and they can't read.

What struck me is the lack of human-centered design principles. The research question is "How can we design a social network for illiterate farmers?" That's an interesting question (that feels decidedly less academic since 3 of the 4 coauthors are Microsoft employees). (As an aside to the thin academic gloss on this project: what exactly do the researchers mean when they say they obtained "informed verbal consent" from the farmers? I would be surprised if the farmers, who have no experience with digital technology or general information sources like newspapers, let alone academic articles, actually understood what they were consenting to.) But it wholly ignores a much broader question: What do illiterate farmers need help doing? The authors make a tenuous connection to a local organization that is using videos and other digital tutorials to disseminate farming and animal tending best practices. Peter F. Drucker, in Entrepreneurship and Innovation (1985), shares a story of European motorbike manufacturers who introduced motorbikes to India, thinking that India's weak transportation sector and poor population were a perfect environment for the cheap, convenient travel afforded by a motorbike. Sales were poor, except in an agricultural area in India. Farmers in the agricultural area were buying the motorbikes for their motors, which they stripped from the motorbikes and used to run irrigation pumps. The engineer who discovered this founded an irrigation pump company and was incredibly successful. Here, we are introducing a social network to India; I wonder what they would do with it if they could strip it for parts.

Then the researchers advise that without "mediators", people who can read, have phones, and have a basic understanding of technology and social networks, this social network would not have worked. Tellingly, the section devoted to the importance of mediator participation is entitled "Incentivization of Mediators Crucial". Even with the mediators, it's not clear that the social network can actually be called a "success" - mediators were responsible for signing up farmers to the social network, but neither the mediators nor farmers could articulate what exactly they received by joining this network. One mediator, who had signed up 35 farmers, "could not tell the farmers what the system was for as he did not know himself." Further, incentives are hard to get right, or it's hard to discern the effects of incentives from what they enable. Salaries partly are incentives to work; they also enable work, providing enough resources for a person not to have to do something else. In any case, there's more to a person's motivation than the "incentive" she receives.

#### Hits
- There is no current good solution for passwords for illiterate and low-literacy users. Whatever one might think of this project, the insight is an important one. Imagine low-literacy users trying to access basic information about themselves, like accessing government aid, or finding out health information.
- "[T]echnological interventions will be more effective if they take into consideration the underlying infrastructures such as intermediation that are embedded in the community." I think this means, Think of communities you are designing for, rather than individuals, because individuals receive support from their communities.

#### Misses
- The idea of informed consent from illiterate farmers about participating in a social network using mobile phones.
- Asking the farmers what they wanted (pictures of gods and actors; religious songs) as a way to "iterate" the next version of the network. Since when did asking users for specific product recommendations yield product features that are innovative, or even actually helpful?

### Bae, J., Lim, Y, Bang, J. & Kim, M. (2014). Ripening Room: Designing Social Media for Self-Expression. *DIS 2014*, 103-112.

#### Overview
Industrial design students in South Korea assert that the fundamental design flaw of social media is that it does not "support users' self-reflection". To remedy this design flaw, they propose a social network website that requires users to select a "ripening time", between 1 minute and 48 hours, during which the post is visible only to them. While the ripening window is open, they can edit the post as much as they like. Once it is posted, they cannot change it.

The students built in a scoring process - a combination of ripening time and votes from other users on a post's "maturity". They intended the scoring process "to motivate users to earn higher points, and an increase in score would give positive feedback, resulting in a a sense of achievement in the social media context."

#### Hits
- The premise is interesting. Why do we carelessly share personal information? Why do we heedlessly interact with others online? Perhaps some sort of delay is helpful.
- Interesting user insights: not interacting with her phone was "40 minutes of endless pain." And "I've tried to get away from smart phones and computers, and focused on reading books. But in 10 minutes, my hand got impatient to touch my phone!"
- The recognition that social media "provide[s] purposeless connectedness and the hedonic pleasures of gossip, not... the pursuit of.. self-reflection. Will users' desire to use social media" fall when the platform encourages self-reflection?

#### Misses
- The assumption that social media can, and should, encourage personal growth: "It is important that social media encourage users to express their inner thoughts and emotions if they are to collect meaningful resources for self-reflection, because it is not always guaranteed that users' activities will create meaningful resources."

### Gentner, D. & Nielson, J. (1996). The Anti-Mac Interface. *Communications of the ACM 39*(8) 71-82.

#### Overview
Is the Windows-Icons-Menu-Pointer model the final innovation in GUIs? Gertner and Nielson hope not - but in the 20 years since this article, I don't see that much has changed.

#### Hits
- The Mac interface is "good enough to be criticized". I think that's a useful way to think about criticism, that we're only criticizing what is good and can become better. We aren't spending time on interfaces that aren't even good to begin with.
- Metaphors are not as helpful as they seem. Cars were originally controlled by reins, like horses, but that metaphor constrained the design without helping drivers. Maybe metaphors are there most helpful when we are working with novel concepts. Learning and adaptation build new mental structures that are better constructs than the original metaphor. Gentner and Nielson strain their analysis here, describing metaphors in terms of mappings between the target and source domain.
- "The dark side of direct manipulation is that you have to manipulate everything."
- If applications arrange themselves to fit our needs, they are dynamic yet feel dependable.
- They make a general point about how much rote work GUIs saddle us with.

#### Misses
- Although their observation that we lack the power of language, and instead must communicate primitively by pointing and clicking, rings true, their design solution - that we should spend as many years mastering interactions with computers as we do with other humans (20, in their estimation) - is absurd and contradicted by their other points that computers should be more responsive to our needs. I also doubt that computers could be programmed with language capability that would evolve with our own. (Until A.I. enables that, at which point there will be other issues to deal with than using natural language to manipulate files on our PCs).
